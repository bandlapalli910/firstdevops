3. 🔐 Private Repo with No Credentials

If the repo is private and no Git credentials are configured, Jenkins may silently fail to fetch commits.

Fix it:

In Jenkins, go to:

Manage Jenkins > Credentials > Add a credential

Choose Username/Password or Personal Access Token (PAT)

In your job config, under Git settings, add that credential

Let me know:

If the repo is public or private

If there’s at least one commit

What the actual branch name is (master, main, etc.)

And I’ll guide you precisely.
